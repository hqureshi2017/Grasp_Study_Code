On Day 1, during the 2nd Grasp trial (-24cm) the sub's thumb came out. The trial was completed as normal and then the entire trial was repeated after end of testing. New 'sub29b' was created to just repeat the -24cm trial. The original data file has been kept as a copy and the 29b folder has also been retained.
